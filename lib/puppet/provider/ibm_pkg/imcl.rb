# Provider for installing and querying packages with IBM Installation
# Manager.  This could almost be a provider for the package resource, but I'm
# not sure how.  We need to be able to support multiple installations of the
# exact same package of the exact same version but in different locations.
#
# This could also use some work.  I'm obviously lacking in Ruby experience and
# familiarity with the Puppet development APIs.
#
# Right now, this is pretty basic - we can check the existence of a package
# and install/uninstall it.  We don't support updating here.  Updating is
# less than trivial.  Updates are done by the user downloading the massive
# IBM package and extracting it in the right way.  For things like WebSphere,
# several services need to be stopped prior to updating.
#
# Version numbers are also weird.  We're using Puppet's 'versioncmp' here,
# which appears to work for IBM's scheme.  Basically, if the specified version
# or a higher version is installed, we consider the resource to be satisfied.
# Specifically, if the specified path has the specified version or greater
# installed, we're satisfied.
#
# IBM Installation Manager keeps an XML file at
# /var/ibm/InstallationManager/installed.xml that includes all the installed
# packages, their locations, "fixpacks", and other useful information. This
# appears to be *much* more useful than the 'imcl' tool, which doesn't return
# terribly useful information (and it's slower).
#
# We attempt to make an educated guess for the location of 'imcl' by parsing
# that XML file.  Otherwise, the user can explicitly provide that via the
# 'imcl_path' parameter.
#
# A user can provide a 'response file' for installation, which will include
# pretty much *all* the information for installing - paths, versions,
# repositories, etc.  Otherwise, they can provide values for the other
# parameters.  Finally, they can provide their own arbitrary options.
